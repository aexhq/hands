//! Host-side mechanics for Hands on **AWS Lambda MicroVMs**.
//!
//! The MicroVM service gives us Firecracker isolation as a product: one VM per session, a
//! Lambda-managed AL2023 base image with our container layer inside it, an authenticated
//! public HTTPS endpoint per VM (JWE in `X-aws-proxy-auth`), traffic-idle auto-suspend, and a
//! hard 8-hour retention wall (running *plus* suspended).
//!
//! Three parts:
//!
//! - [`image`] — the pipeline: generated Dockerfile + guest binary + boot script packed into a
//!   ZIP, uploaded to S3, registered with `CreateMicrovmImage`/`UpdateMicrovmImage` (AWS runs
//!   the build), and checked against the managed base's deprecation schedule (images expire on
//!   AWS's calendar, not ours).
//! - [`control`] — typed lifecycle calls (`RunMicrovm`/`Get`/`Suspend`/`Resume`/`Terminate`,
//!   `CreateMicrovmAuthToken`) with explicit retryable, throttled, unknown-effect, gone and fatal
//!   classifications. State-changing 5xx/transport failures are never called safe retries.
//! - [`launch`] — exact-replay launch against a durably sealed request, delivery of the
//!   immutable secret-free target seal through the run hook, readiness waiting, and the guest
//!   WebSocket connect. The Hand deliberately has no independent keepalive loop.
