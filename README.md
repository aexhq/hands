Hands implements the Hand ports owned by Brain. It consumes one immutable Brain revision, so wire
contract changes start in [`aexhq/brain`](https://github.com/aexhq/brain) before the pin changes
here.

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`hand-core`](crates/hand-core) | Contract-neutral operation, target, generation, connector, and cleanup state machines |
| [`hand-wire`](crates/hand-wire) | Private transport framing for the production Hand |
| [`hand-guest`](crates/hand-guest) | WebSocket guest, tool runner, bounded output, jobs, and live file access |
| [`hand-brain-aws`](crates/hand-brain-aws) | Lambda MicroVM implementation of Brain's receipt and capability ports |
| [`hand-lambda`](crates/hand-lambda) | Image publication, lifecycle controls, and hosted runtime checks |
| [`hand-egress-gateway`](crates/hand-egress-gateway) | Signed-capability CONNECT and SOCKS allowlist gateway |
| [`gateway`](gateway) | Low-privilege egress gateway image and deployment contract |
| [`image`](image) | Curated Linux tool image |
| [`scripts`](scripts) | Node bundle and guest security conformance fixtures |

## Development

The guest is Linux-only and uses process groups, signals, and `/proc`.

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
node scripts/test-tool-runner.mjs
```

CI also builds the Linux image and proves that a malicious Tool UID cannot reach the supervisor
control listener. Production publishes only the immutable egress-gateway image and plane-local
Lambda MicroVM images.

Read the [tool image guide](image/README.md), [egress gateway contract](gateway/README.md), or
[AWS adapter contract](crates/hand-brain-aws/README.md) for runtime details. Hosted Brain
composition belongs to Aex; this repository has no standalone or hosted Brain image.
